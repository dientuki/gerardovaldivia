Hyper Cache is flexible and easy to configure cache system for WordPress. It's aim is to work on any installation.

== Description ==

Hyper Cache is a new cache system for WordPress, specifically written for
people which have their blogs on low resources hosting provider 
(cpu and mysql). It works even with hosting based on Microsoft IIS (just tuning
the configuration). It has three invalidation method: all the cache, single post
